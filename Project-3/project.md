# Criteria A: Planning


## Problem Definition

Mr. M, the manager of MR. M Restro, is facing immense challenges in managing his restaurant and growing his business. Despite his efforts, his restaurant still relies on outdated methods, like collecting customer reviews and ratings through paper forms. Advertising is done via posters and pamphlets, which are largely ignored in today’s digital age. These methods have not only become inconvenient for customers, but they’ve also backfired, leaving Mr. M struggling to keep up with competitors.
He has tried various approaches, such as posting on social media and tracking data trends manually in spreadsheets, but these methods are cumbersome, time-consuming, and ultimately inefficient. His employees are burdened with the task of conducting surveys and brainstorming ways to attract customers, leaving little time or energy to focus on what truly matters: serving food and creating a great dining experience. The customers also really struggle to get the right preference of their taste on dishes and a manage budget for it and its also very difficult to navigate and get proper guidance on Mr.M Restro. The supplies of ingredients to Mr.M Restro also struggle to store and supply the ingredients to the restaurant as they don’t have the proper data and information to supply.
To make matters worse, the highly competitive nature of the restaurant industry makes it increasingly difficult for MR. M Retro to stand out. Just last month, Mr. M’s restaurant was on the brink of bankruptcy. This wake-up call made him realize that the old methods could no longer sustain his business in a fast-evolving market.
Watching his employees work tirelessly, distributing cards and pamphlets, only to see them grow exhausted and discouraged, has taken a toll on Mr. M both personally and professionally. The strain has deeply affected both his life and his business. 



## Proposed Solution

To help overcome these challenges of Mr.M Retro (restaurants), I propose a data-driven digital food platform that connects restaurants, users, and food suppliers where Mr.M Restro can advertise their menu and add new dishes and features on that platform. Users or food critics can write reviews and rate it each dish as well as see others' reviews and ratings. Users can also choose and sort the dishes according to their preferences and taste, and see the average price, distance, and location of Mr.M Restro branches. To make it a more engaging and gamified experience the platform will show today's special dishes to try on and display the highest-rated dishes with positive reviews. The user will be accompanied with very powerful ai trained model chatbot which can provide any response related to the Mr.M restro as well as food related queries. It will help the users to navigate the user throught the platform which will boost their engagement and experience. For the restaurant, they will be able to put the details of the specialty on the platform. For the producer, they will be able to see the graph and trend between the rating and the dishes. And furthermore they can download the graph and analyze the graph more closely and get the information which ingredients and supplies to include in their inventory and supplies to the restaurant. The solution here will help Mr.M restro to boost so much as the platform will help all the major supplies and connected people of restaurants.

*Fig. 1* illustrates the system, its parts, inputs, and output. The relationships between them are shown as well. The application takes user input from the keyboard and mouse, the computer details and the software it's running are included in the diagram. The python environment is VS-Code, in which two coding languages, python and KivyMD are ran. They interact with the relational database "project.db" inside the Vs-Code environment. The output is displayed on a screen.
